Description of the Deep Learning Code for MNIST Classification
This Python script demonstrates how to build a simple Deep Learning model using TensorFlow and Keras APIs to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known dataset consisting of handwritten digits (0–9), and is a common starting point for deep learning beginners.

The main steps in this project are: loading the data, preprocessing, building the model, compiling it, training the model, and evaluating the performance. Let's break it down in detail:

1. Importing Required Libraries
python
Copy
Edit
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
TensorFlow (tf) is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It simplifies building, training, and deploying deep learning models.

layers and models from tensorflow.keras are used to create neural networks easily.

mnist from tensorflow.keras.datasets provides ready-to-use MNIST digit images.

2. Loading and Preprocessing the Dataset
python
Copy
Edit
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0
The MNIST dataset is automatically downloaded and split into:

x_train, y_train: Training data (60,000 images)

x_test, y_test: Testing data (10,000 images)

Each image is 28x28 pixels, and each pixel has a value between 0 and 255.

Normalization is performed by dividing the pixel values by 255.0:

This scales pixel values between 0 and 1.

It helps the model train faster and more efficiently, because neural networks perform better with smaller input values.

3. Building the Neural Network Model
python
Copy
Edit
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
A Sequential model is used, meaning layers are stacked one after another.

Layers in the model:

Flatten layer:

Input is a 28x28 image.

Flatten converts the 2D image into a 1D array (784 features) so it can be processed by dense layers.

Dense layer (Hidden layer):

128 neurons with ReLU activation.

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) introduces non-linearity, allowing the network to learn complex patterns.

Dense layer (Output layer):

10 neurons (one for each class: digits 0–9).

Softmax activation is used to output probabilities for each class, and the class with the highest probability is the prediction.

4. Compiling the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
Optimizer: Adam

An efficient optimization algorithm that adjusts learning rates automatically.

It is widely used for training deep learning models.

Loss Function: sparse_categorical_crossentropy

Since labels are integers (0–9) and not one-hot encoded, sparse categorical crossentropy is used.

Metric: Accuracy

Accuracy is monitored to see how well the model is performing during training and testing.

5. Training the Model
python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
Training is performed for 5 epochs.

One epoch means the model sees the entire training data once.

Validation Data is provided:

This helps monitor how well the model is performing on unseen data after each epoch.

If validation accuracy stops improving, it can help in deciding to stop training earlier.

6. Evaluating the Model
python
Copy
Edit
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
After training, the model's final performance is evaluated using the test set.

test_loss gives the final loss value, and test_acc shows the final accuracy on unseen test data.

The result (Test accuracy) is printed, which tells how well the model has learned to classify handwritten digits.

Summary
This code is a classic example of how deep learning models are built step-by-step using TensorFlow:

Data Loading and Preprocessing (normalize inputs)

Model Building (Flatten → Dense layers)

Compilation (optimizer, loss, metrics)

Training (with validation)

Evaluation (final accuracy)

Even though the model is very simple, it can achieve high accuracy (around 97%-98%) on the MNIST dataset. This small project forms the foundation of understanding more complex neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) later.
